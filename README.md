# Linear-Algebra
Git Book Practice ( Step by step approach to AI )

I rewrote the matlab code described in the Git Book, https://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbooks.io/artificial-inteligence/ in python.
There may be errors and you are welcome to correct me. I also added some code that I just copied and pasted from the author in case I look at when I need.
